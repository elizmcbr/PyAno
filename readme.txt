This project is a virtual piano keyboard that allows the user to play music using the keyboard as note input. The display shows a range of two octaves at a time, but the user can toggle between octaves using the arrow keys, thus allowing access to eight octaves, the range of a full-size piano. Also, for ease of use, the user can also choose to display the symbols of the keyboard keys that correspond to the piano keys on screen. 

An additional functionality allows the user to record sounds he or she plays and have them play back. The user first clicks the "Record" button, plays the pitches he or she wants, clicks the "Stop" button to stop recording, and clicks the "Play" button to play the sounds back. 

Additionally, there is an instructions screen, accesssed by clicking on the button labeled "Instructions," which offers directions for how to use the program. 

To install the program, download the pyano.py file, the splashImage.jpg file and the "pitches" folder into the same directory. Make sure you are running Python 2.6. Also, it will be necessary to have the pygame package installed. To get it, go to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml and find the pygame-1.9.1 file that corresponds to both Python 2.6 and your operating system. Note, if you are running 64-bit Windows, you can go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and download an unofficial version of Pygame. In that event, you must still make sure to choose the file that corresponds to Python 2.6. On either site, once you find the file that you want to install, click on the link and follow the instructions given by the installer. Verify that your Python26\Lib\site-packages contains a directory called "pygame."

Once pygame is installed, go back to the folder where you downloaded the pyano.py file. Double-click on it. It should open up and begin running. To close the program, you can either click the close-window button on the program display window or press "x" on the computer keyboard.
